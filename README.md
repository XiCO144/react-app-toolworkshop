# Vite - React and TypeScript Car Tool-Workshop Project
The "Car Tool Workshop Project" is a fully functional reactive site where you can schedule your car revisions as a customer. This project also integrates an administration dashboard where the boss and employees can see all relevant information about the Car Tool Workshop.

# Vite Framework & Web Development

This project is made with the React framework "Vite". The reason I chose React and Typescript was because of it's complexity and to gain new knowledge in the world of web development.
