The "Car Tool Workshop Project" is a fully functional reactive site where you can schedule your car revisions as a customer. This project also integrates an administration dashboard where the boss and employees can see all relevant information about the Car Tool Workshop.
Vite Framework & Web Development

This project is made with the React framework "Vite". The reason I chose React and Typescript was because of it's complexity and to gain new knowledge in the world of web development.
Aims & objectives

My project consists of making a website for a company in urgent need of one, while learning with everything I do and search while developing the project. I have the following goals:

  - Use the Vite framework to develop skills so I can better use React, TypeScript, Node.Js and libraries;
  * Use Github with Gitbash to store and organise all the information I need;
  + Organise myself and the project while making it better and bigger.
