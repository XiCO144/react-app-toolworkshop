# Vite - React and TypeScript Car Tool-Workshop Project

The "Car Tool-Workshop Projectt" is a fully functional reactive page where you can schedule your car revisions as a client. This project also integrates an administrative dashboard, where the boss and employee can see all relevant information about the Car Tool-Workshop.
## Vite Framework & Web Developing

This project it's made with the React framework "Vite". The reason I choose React and Typescript was because of it's complexity and to gain new knowledge in the world of web developing.
##Permission System

Laravel makes it easy to develop a permission system using it's middlware. Middleware it's a group of security levels, you can create your own security level and make users need to do something before they proceed to other steps. What I did with middleware was:

    User needs to be logged in to make most of actions (such as add products to your cart);
    To access the administrative backoffice you need it's role, otherwise it redirects you to an unauthorized page (403 error);
    You must be e-mail verified to access backoffice (if administrator), access your profile and even buy something from the store.
## Pagination and Filters

We can all agree that making a pagination and/or filters from scratch can sometimes be either very boring or difficult, but with Laravel I can just simply use the links method and a pagination will be done. Of course not everything comes with only a good side. Working the store filters with pagination was one of the most difficult things I did in my project, either way, it allows you to do the following:

    Filter product types and collections or even price;
    Paginate through products (20 per page);
    Use both together, intuitively, where you can just filter a product and search it throughout pages.

## Objectives & Goals

My project consists in making a website for a enterprise in the urgent need of one while learning with everything I do and search while I develop the project. As objetives, I have the following:

    Use the Laravel framework to develop skills so I can better use other frameworks;
    Use Github with Gitbash to keep all the information I need stored;
    Organize myself and the project while making it better and bigger;
